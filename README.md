# CSS media reporter

/* todo:
Want to make a admin settings pannel where the user can:

	- set up custom rules and colors
	- set display text
	- load commomn media breakpoints ie bootstrap responsive
	- Drag and drop the rule order so that it makes sense to the user
	- See the generated style sheet (something they can copy-paste)
	- display pixel width (may be fooled if width of container is adjusted beyond the )
	- add custom CSS in a final feild that overwrites any defaults listed above.

	Incriment a value between a range (think hsla numbers) for rule bg color
